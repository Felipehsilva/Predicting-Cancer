# Predicting-Cancer

routine breast examination allows the disease to be diagnosed and treated before causing
noticeable symptoms. The early detection process involves the analysis of nodules or masses
abnormal breast tissue. If a nodule is found, an aspiration biopsy with
fine needle is performed, which uses a hollow needle to extract a small sample of
cells. A clinician then examines the cells under a microscope to determine if the
mass is likely to be malignant or benign. If machine learning can
automate the identification of cancer cells, this would be an important achievement for the
health system. Automated processes make it possible to improve the efficiency of the
detection, allowing doctors to diagnose the problem, assess the expense
necessary to resolve and still define the time needed for the treatment of the disease. One
automated tracking system can also provide greater accuracy of
detection by removing the inherently subjective human component from the process.
We will investigate the usefulness of machine learning to detect cancer by applying the
k-NN classification algorithm for cell measurements from biopsies of women
with abnormal breast nodules.
We will use real data, provided by the UCI Machine Learning repository, at this link:
